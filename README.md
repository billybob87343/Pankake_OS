# Pankake_OS
This is going to be Pankake OS (I know its spelled wrong)
This is a silly little project I hope turns out good, and I want to treat it like a challenge.
Rules for this:
1:No AI
2:No stealing stuff(debatable)
3:Work on every day, even for a little.
4:Open source for everyone
5:Learn from this

Aditional notes
If a file has no code in it, I will get to it I am just piecing everything together.
I want to have updates in here so check to see what is diffrent from time to time.
Have a great day!-Billybob87343/[TTG]LOL
